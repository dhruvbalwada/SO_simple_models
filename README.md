# SO_simple_models

MATLAB solvers for simple models of Southern Ocean dynamics.

1. MR_2D - Solves for the model that was introduced in Marshall and Radko 2003. Zonally averaged along ACC streamlines with buoyancy relaxation, fixed mixed layer depths and a wind stress. 
2. MR_3D - Building on the MR_2D model to find solutions with a simple modal structure in the zonal direction. Solve for zonally averaged solution + first zonal mode. 
3. BW_2010 - Badin and Williams 2010 model that introduced the next level of complexity by having a fixed slab mixed layer that is forced by heat and freshwater fluxes and solves for a mixed layer temp and salt. Assumes a fixed depth mixed layer.
